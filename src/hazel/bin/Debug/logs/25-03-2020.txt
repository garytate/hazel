It's not a particularly hard throw, mainly because Vurr isn't trying to fucking break any bones or anything crazy, but it's hard enough that if she managed to hit it chest-first, she might have the air knocked out of her.

They stumble forward a bit towards her as their other arm now lifts up- bearing a particularly meaty fist, which tries to slam forward and bop her straight in the noggin.

Their other hoof raises up as she falls down- and they try to slam it down onto her vest, not full force, that'd fucking kill her, but with enough pressure to keep her pinned and out of breath. But it does take a few seconds to lift up, so she could roll out of the way.
